In this lab, we're going to implement 4 basic linked list's operation.

push(int value) : Push a node at the tail of linked list

insert(int pos, int value) : Insert a node at the given position in the linked list, if given position is bigger than the length of the list, output "insert fail".

remove(int pos) : Remove a node at the given position in the linked list, if given position is bigger than the length of the list, output "remove fail".

find(int value) : Find the position of the node which it's value equals given number, if there doesn't exist such node, return -1.

Input Format

On the first line of input is a single positive integer 𝑛, telling the number of operations to follow.

You don't need to handle input.

Constraints
