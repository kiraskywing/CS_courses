We want you to use virtual function to practice polymorphism.

Input Format
We performs three shapes: cuboid, pyramid and sphere. The input is the parameters of the three shapes. All of the input is a float.

cuboid : length, width and height
pyramid : area of base, height
sphere : radius
Here's the formula used to calculate their volume.

cuboid : length * width * height
pyramid : area of base * height / 3
sphere : 4/3 * radius^3 * 3.14
Constraints

Do not modify the main function and the class Shape.

Output Format
Output is the volume of the three shapes.
