In this challenge, we're going to implement two simple hash tables using the hash function h(x). h(x) = x % 19
Open addressing hash table using linear probing. Linear Probing (key, probe) = hash(key) + probe
Open addressing hash table using quadratic probing. Quadratic Probing (key, probe) = hash(key) + probe²

Input Format
On the first line of input is a single positive integer 𝑛, telling how many elements need to be add to the hash table. On the second line will be 𝑛 numbers, which will be add to the hash table in order.

Constraints
2 <= 𝑛 <= 19.

Output Format
You need to output the hash table after adding all the numbers. Output 0 when the bucket is empty.
The first line will be the linear probing one. The second line will be the quadratic probing one.
