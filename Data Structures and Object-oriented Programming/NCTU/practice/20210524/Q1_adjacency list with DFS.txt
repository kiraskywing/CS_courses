In this challenge, the input is a adjacency matrix of a undirected graph, you need to compute its connected component labeling using DFS.

Input Format
The first line N is the number of the graph's vertices. The second line is the size NxN adjacency matrix.

Output Format
Please print all the connected components, show the vertices in each connected component in one line. You also need to print the isolated nodes as a connected component. Remember to order the vertices from least to greatest for each connected component.
