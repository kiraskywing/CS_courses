There are three kinds of bracket pairs, (), [], {}.
A set of the brackets is considered balanced if
(1) all the brackets in the set can be paired, and
(2) any subset of the bracket pair is a balanced bracket set.
For example, {}{()[]} is balanced, and ([()] is not balanced.

Please use stack to examine if the bracket set is balanced.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, represeting the number of strings. 1 ≤ n ≤ 5. Each of the next lines contains a string of a bracket set.

Constraints
Use stack to implement.

Output Format
Print the evaluation of the string of a bracket set. Print "yes" if the bracket set is balanced, print "no" otherwise.
